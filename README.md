## project-pulse

This is where you include your WebPart documentation.

### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
npm i
npm i -g gulp
gulp
```

This package produces the following:

* lib/* - intermediate-stage commonjs build artifacts
* dist/* - the bundled script, along with other resources
* deploy/* - all resources which should be uploaded to a CDN.

### Build options

gulp clean - TODO

### TODO

Currently using the path below but should change to a CDN:

https://mcdonnell.sharepoint.com/CDN/SiteAssets/mcd79spfx/projectpulse/

CDN path:

https://publiccdn.sharepointonline.com/mcdonnell.sharepoint.com/17010057ba9cb512378a36c5a527037405aae98495ac81c4c4b93d481ef919a03e6d02e3/projectpulse/

Could be Github published for other use?
